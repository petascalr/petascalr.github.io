**Specflare** is my personal blog that I use to keep track of my projects and notes related to my field of work.  

As a professional Software Engineer and general problem solver, I've been practicing this craft for more than 13 years and 
I'm still learning something new everyday about it.  

I started my professional career back in 2008 as a C++ Backend Engineer, working for a video game [company](https://www.ubisoft.com).
Then, after 2 years I moved to another company developing software for the Telecom industry (Switches, Routers, Firewalls), working there for a long time (~7 years). This is where I got deeply into the Linux internals, Networking Protocols and Security.  

I am currently working as a Lead/Senior Software Engineer for VIAVI Solutions, doing mostly Java/Scala, Kafka, Kubernetes/Helm and related technlogies.  

I enjoy sharing the things I learned so you can get a head start.

Feel free to [contact me](mailto: specflare@gmail.com) if you find my blog useful or you are interested in any kind of collaboration.
