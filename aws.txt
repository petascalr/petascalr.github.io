Common AWS Services:
	* AWS CloudFormation: provides a common language for you to model and provision AWS and third party application resources in your cloud environment. 
		AWS CloudFormation allows you to use programming languages or a simple text file to model and provision, in an automated and secure manner, 
		all the resources needed for your applications across all regions and accounts. Basically it offers IaaS.
		
	* EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud): Virtual machines inside AWS.
	* S3: Simple Storage Services: simple storage services of objects, by key. Most basic storage.
	* Aurora: Optimized MySQL/PostgreSQL, that runs 
	* DynamoDB: A NoSQL database from AWS, similar to MongoDB.
	* RDS (Relational Database Service) manages the other DB services.
	* AWS Route 53 (reference to TCP/UDP port 53 for DNS): AWS Service to purchase domain names.
	* AWS CloudFront: CDN network from AWS.
	* AWS VPC (Virtual Private Cloud): lets you provision a logically isolated section of the AWS Cloud where you can launch AWS resources in a virtual network 
		that you define. You have complete control over your virtual networking environment, including selection of your own IP address range, 
		creation of subnets, and configuration of route tables and network gateways. You can use both IPv4 and IPv6 in your VPC for secure and easy access 
		to resources and applications.
	* AWS Lambda is an event-driven, serverless computing platform.
	* AWS SecurityGroups: Are like a FW Policy that only contain Proto/Port/Source. 
		Destination is always the device on which the SecGroup is applied. Action is always ALLOW. A SG can be applied to multiple instances.
	* AWS CloudWatch: monitoring for your cloud resources.
	* AWS IAM: Identity and Access Management for users & groups with permissions to allow/deny them access to AWS resources. It is like LDAP on-prem.
	* Amazon ElastiCache for Redis: In memory data-base.
