Machine Learning
Purpose of machine learning is to discover recurring patterns in the data.
Sample datasets: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.php

ML can be split in:
	- Supervised Learning (develop predictive model based on both input and output data)
		- Classification (output is a choice between classes/labels: true/false. red/green/blue).
			The output has discreete values in classification.
			
		- Regression (output is a number: stock prices, temperature, etc)
			The output is continuous in regression.

	- Unsupervised Learning (discover an internal representation from input datra only)
		- Clustering: no output; find natural groups and patterns from input data only.
			e.g.: optimal placement of GSM antennas so that all customers receive good service.
