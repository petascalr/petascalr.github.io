SSL / TLS / Cryptography

Introduction
	- Secure Socket Layer (SSL) was invented in 1994 by Netscape.
	- TLS was created by IETF as a successor to SSL.


Symmetric key encryption algorithms (one secret key only):
	- Symmetric-key algorithms[a] are algorithms for cryptography that use the same cryptographic keys for both encryption of plaintext and decryption of ciphertext.
	- 2 types: Block ciphers & Stream ciphers.
		- DES (56 bit key, 64 bit block size), 
		- 3DES (key sizes: 168, 112, 56 bits), block size: 64 bits.
		- AES: key sizes: 128, 192 or 256 bits. block sizes: 128 bits.
		- RC4: stream cipher.
	- Diffie Hellman Key Exchange

Hashes:
	- md5: 128 bit hash function
	- sha1: 160 bits hash function
	- taking the output nobody should be able to algoritmically construct an input.
	- hashes are also used for password storage

MACs / HMACs: Message Authentication Codes
	- keyed hashes; hasing with data+a shared secret.
	- MAC is a string of bits that is sent alongside a message. The MAC depends on the message itself and a secret key. No one should be able to compute a MAC without knowing the key.
	- HMAC is a recipe for turning hash functions (such as MD5 or SHA256) into MACs. So HMAC-MD5 and HMAC-SHA256 are specific MAC algorithms, just like QuickSort is a specific sorting algorithm.

Asymetric (Public Key) Encryption
	- each peer has 2 keys (public + private).
	- public keys are usually sent along with a certificate.
	- Drawback: slow for large messages - use it as little as possible - big bit-length for keys.
	- it is used generally for agreeing on an encryption key for a symmetric algorithm (used in key exchange phase)
	- RSA: most popular
	- ECC: Elliptic Curve Criptography: same purpose as public keys but faster with smaller keys.

Digital signatures:
- public key and private keys are interchangeable
- MACS are not any usefull because they require a shared key.
