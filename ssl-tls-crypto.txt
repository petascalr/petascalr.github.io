SSL / TLS / Cryptography

Symmetric key encryption (one key only):
- Diffie Hellman Key Exchange
- DES3: Best known same key cipher available
- DES: will eventually replace DES3.
- RC4
- DES: 56 bit keys

Asymetric (Public Key) Encryption
- each peer has 2 keys (public + private)
- public keys are usually sent along with a certificate
- Drawback: slow for large messages
- use it as little as possible
- it is used generally for agreeing on an encryption key for a symmetric algorithm (used in key exchange phase)
- RSA: most popular
- big bitlength for keys
- ECC: Elliptic Curve Criptography: same purpose as public keys but faster with smaller keys

Hashes and MACs:
- md5: 128 bit hash function
- sha1: 160 bits hash function
- taking the output nobody should be able to algoritmically construct an input.
- hashes are also used for password storage
- MACs: keyed hashes; hasing with data+a shared secret.
- HMAC: can be used with any message digest algorithm.

Digital signatures:
- public key and private keys are interchangeable
- MACS are not any usefull because they require a shared key.
